# Advent of Code 2020

[Day 10](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/10) was really hard for me.
I found a very cumbersome solution with exponential runtime.
I head to cheat a little bit and check for an answer on the internet and found
this impressive solution on  [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE88K2kFZn0).
The answer was to use recursion and dynamic programming (memoization) to get the
complexity down to O(n*n).
